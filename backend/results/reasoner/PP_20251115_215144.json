    "reasoning": "The parsed policies are syntactically complete and contain clear, enforceable permissions and prohibitions with a valid expiry date. No high‑severity issues such as action conflicts, unenforceable clauses, or expired policies were detected. The only concerns are low‑severity omissions: the assigner field is marked as 'not_specified', the policy type is a generic odrl:Set rather than a more specific Offer/Agreement, and the permission rule lacks associated duties. These do not prevent ODRL generation but should be addressed for completeness and best practice.",
