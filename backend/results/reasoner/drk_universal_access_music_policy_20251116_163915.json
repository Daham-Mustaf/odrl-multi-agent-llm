    "reasoning": "The policy uses the unmeasurable actor term \"everyone\", which is a vague and unenforceable specification according to the ODRL contradiction detection rules. This constitutes a HIGH severity issue. Additionally, the policy is overly broad by granting unrestricted read access to all music files in the archive without any constraints, which further raises enforceability concerns. Both issues require concrete, measurable definitions before the policy can be considered enforceable.",
