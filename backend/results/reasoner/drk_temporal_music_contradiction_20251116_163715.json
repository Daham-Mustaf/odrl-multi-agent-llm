    "reasoning": "The single policy contains an intra‑policy conflict flagged by metadata (has_conflicting_constraints = true). Two dateTime constraints on the same leftOperand use different constraint_group values, which is a high‑severity contradiction. Moreover, the textual meaning creates a temporal conflict: the rule states the track is available only after 2025, yet also permits use in 2024 for educational purposes. These contradictions make the policy unenforceable. No vague or unmeasurable terms were found, but the identified conflicts are sufficient to reject the policy set.",
