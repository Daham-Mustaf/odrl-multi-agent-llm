    "reasoning": "The policy contains unmeasurable/vague terms and is overly broad, both of which are classified as HIGH severity issues. The actor is expressed as \"Nobody\", which is an undefined universal quantifier that cannot be enforced. Additionally, the policy prohibits \"anything\" for \"nobody\" on an unspecified target, resulting in a total prohibition without any scope, making it unimplementable. These high‑severity problems require the policy to be rewritten before it can be accepted.",
